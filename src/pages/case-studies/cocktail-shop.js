          The client already had a very successful offline experience with
          several bars, but they wanted to catch the attention of current and
          new customers by providing an online platform to create and order
          cocktails effortlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The backend team built the initial features and produced API
          documentation, while the design team delivered the full web app design
          for the frontend development to kickoff. My contribution was in the
          frontend team where I was in charge of leading the technical
          development, and weekly deliveries with a team of 2 developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We started by identifying the frontend features and interrogations
          regarding the APIs for the e-commerce experience. As we laid out the
          features in the Backlog and estimated the effort for planning the
          first Sprints, we also assessed the design guidelines, desktop, and
          mobile UI design. For respecting the grid’s guideline, we had to build
          a custom grid and study the User Interface (UI) architecture in search
          of reusable components. The latter was an arduous process since the UI
          wasn’t defined with the premise of reusable and self-contained
          elements which would save time in the frontend development. Hence, we
          had in many situations to approach the design and adapt accordingly,
          with respective validation, to save development time without
          dismissing the customer experience and design provided by the team.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, we were able to successfully deliver the cocktail shop for
          a final review before going live for the delight of the client’s
          customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our methodology included weekly Sprints, User Acceptance Testing for
          each feature/fix, Pair Programming, Code Review, Continuous
          Integration, and Continuous Delivery.

          The frontend application was built with Next.js, the React framework
          for Server-Side rendering (SSR), and Express. Next.js was selected
          because of its opinionated setup with webpack, file-system routing,
          automatic code splitting for a fast page loading, and being SEO
          friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was my first production SSR project; hence we encountered several
          issues before the main foundations were ready to deliver any features.
          With SSR the initial request for a page is handled on the server so
          that the browser can render the HTML page with the content already in
          place. In subsequent loadings, only the client-side is called into
          action. Therefore, we reviewed the approach of using Redux, cookies,
          local storage, and testing in general, to correctly run in a
          multi-environment like the one existing in SSR.
        </p>
        <p>
          My contribution was mainly in the authentication system, my account,
          orders, addresses, and favorites drinks management, basket and
          checkout system integrated with Stripe. All the delivered features
          were fully tested, and the Backend REST APIs were mocked not to
          trigger unnecessary HTTP requests during testing procedures. Each
          deploy initiated the pipeline, in a Continous Integration server, for
          build verification and errors detection before the weekly release.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding frontend performance, we included critical-path
          (above-the-fold) CSS to reduce page-blocking content, assets caching,
          image optimization, CSS/JS minification via webpack, and GZIP
          compression. Security was also a primary concern for this application.
          Hence, several HTTP headers and good practices were used, such as CSP,
          DNS prefetching control, HTTP Strict Transport Security, XSS
          protections, environment variables, and JWT for authentication between
          frontend and backend APIs.
