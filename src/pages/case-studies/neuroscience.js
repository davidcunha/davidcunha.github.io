          <h3>Story and Process</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          The client had a Neuropsychology clinic with several highly skilled professionals from
          this field: Ph.D.&apos;s, developers and researchers. With hundreds of patients every
          week, their team was studying new processes and innovative approaches for reducing effort
          and time spent to understand the behavioral and cognitive effects of neurological
          disorders.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Neurofeedback (NFB)</h4>
        <p>
          The treatment with Neurofeedback was slow, it required several 3rd party software with
          expensive licenses, and multiple skilled resources to analyze the output of each session,
          a task that could take a couple of weeks or even a month. Therefore the client&apos;s NFB
          team started by designing an algorithm and a microcomputer connected to a headset that
          would be used by patients during the treatment. The algorithm processed brain wave
          information, substituting a couple of different software, and send it to a backend for
          persisting in a database.
        </p>
        <p>
          I led a small team of 2 developers that was in charge of building the backend, data model,
          parser of the data collected by the microcomputer, and an interactive dashboard for
          technicians. Firstly we joined the client&apos;s NFB team for understanding the existing
          process and which features and information were crucial for the technician&apos;s
          dashboard. While the Design team was sketching the UI/UX, we inspected the data collected
          by the microcomputer and validated the data model with the client&apos;s team before
          starting to build the actual APIs and parser. During the following months, the team
          delivered every 2 weeks a new release of the parser and implemented the required features
          for the dashboard. At the same time, we were building the parser and data model, we got
          aware of the challenge and the complexity regarding data structure and validation. It
          required extensive testing by both teams and was a time-consuming process during a
          significant part of the project. Unfortunately, we didn&apos;t find a more productive and
          accessible way to simulate brain waves&apos; good datasets within the 6-month deadline and
          resources both teams had available.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, we were able to deliver the prototype: dashboard, backend APIs, and parser,
          all integrated with the microcomputer, which decreased the time spent in treatment&apos;s
          analysis from a couple of weeks to 2 minutes. The prototype had bugs and wasn&apos;t
          completely reliable since the microcomputer algorithm was also being developed and
          adjusted based on the tests&apos; results. Nevertheless, the client considered it a good
          starting point for further investment and demo purposes.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Neurogames (NG)</h4>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the treatment with Neurogames was brand new. It was state of the art
          applied methodology with 7 cognitive games, and an extensive list of metrics and formulas
          to gather results from the treatment. The client didn&apos;t have any technical team
          besides the researchers that established the methodology and metrics, and a designer that
          crafted the UI for the games.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also led a team of 2 developers, during the time the NFB project was running, that
          delivered every 2 weeks a new release of the games and backend functionalities. One of the
          team members was a specialist in motion, 3D and game development, while my experience in
          that area was minimal, the guidance was mostly towards code best practices, documentation
          and deliverables&apos; quality than in the technology per se. The developer studied the
          several documents created by the research team and managed the expectations regarding the
          functionalities of each game. The 7 cognitive games were all different from each other,
          with several sublevels, and there was a requirement for high time precision for each
          collected data point. Those data points were paramount for validating the treatment and
          comparing it with other existing strategies based on games. Consequently, game development
          was the biggest challenge of this project. For the dashboard, we reduced the development
          time significantly by building a components library from the NFB dashboard. This library
          was then used in the NG dashboard, as we implemented only specific features on top.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, we were able to deliver the prototype: dashboard, backend APIs, and 7 games,
          before the deadline. The prototype was then validated by real patients in the clinic,
          while bugs and small adjustments were developed to match the client&apos;s expectations.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our methodology included fortnightly Sprints, User Acceptance Testing, Pair Programming, Code Review, Continuous Integration, and Continuous
          Delivery.

        <h4>Neurofeedback (NFB)</h4>
        <p>
          The architecture of the NFB project consists of numerous REST APIs serving the dashboard
          and the microcomputer connected to a headset. We developed the backend with Node.js and
          MySQL. However, there were specific requirements regarding data parsing, validation, and
          performance, that were the biggest challenges of this project. The microcomputer,
          developed by the client&apos;s NFB team, collected and processed the brain wave
          information before sending it to the backend.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a first version, the microcomputer sent data files with specific structures for the
          backend to parse, validate, and persist. Some of the files had dependencies between each
          other. Hence each parsing activity was added as a task into priority queues from RabbitMQ.
          We designed a solution that used a modern parser to process the strings of characters from
          the files into JSON, for being more convenient to validate and persist data in a Node.js
          environment. In just one patient&apos;s treatment with Neurofeedback, the number of
          entries added to the database could be enormous, more specifically 10 of thousands of data
          points. To comply with a functional design that would respect quick read access in the
          dashboard, we opted to use a sharding mechanism to separate the database into small chunks
          of data. The queries would be more intricated, but we would then offer an interactive
          experience that even with a good indexing strategy wasn&apos;t reachable. Our team worked
          hard to release a stable version for end-to-end testing, as both prototype and
          microcomputer were continuously in development, but the parsing strategy and queue
          mechanism were sometimes not completely reliable during the testing period.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding the dashboard, it was developed with React and Redux, and integrated with the
          backend REST APIs. The dashboard had several features, such as login, patient&apos;s
          management, technician account, and data analysis of each Neurofeedback session with
          charts and tables. We used D3.js for data visualization since several of the presented
          charts were explicitly designed to give the most information possible to the technicians.
          For frontend performance, we included critical-path (above-the-fold) CSS to reduce
          page-blocking content, assets caching, image optimization, CSS/JS minification via
          webpack, and GZIP compression. Security was also a primary concern for this application.
          Hence, several HTTP headers and good practices were used, environment variables, and JWT
          for authentication between frontend and backend APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The backend infrastructure was set up in a Private Cloud, as required by the client, who
          had internal servers available in a private network.
        </p>

          <img src={caseStudyNFBArchitecture} alt="Neuroscience NFB Architecture" />
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Neurogames (NG)</h4>
        <p>
          The architecture of the NG project also consisted of various REST APIs serving the
          dashboard and the Games UI. We developed the backend with Node.js and MySQL. Each one of
          the 7 cognitive games had specific rules that could be managed by the Administrator. Those
          rules were supported by a dedicated engine that selected the correct assets from the
          assets engine, since all games were based on visual assets, namely, vector and raster. The
          assets had positive and negative metadata associated, which were used on the treatment
          analysis results and determination of the right games sequence for that specific patient.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Games UI was developed in JavaScript, using the Pixi.js engine. Pixi is one of the
          most mature solutions for HTML5 games that allowed us to have the whole team working under
          the same development workflow. As we know, the behavior of the same features across
          different browsers is not reliable. During the games development, there was fundamental
          research about time precision and 60fps animations for the web, focused solely on Chrome,
          our unique browser to provide support in this initial release. As a result, we used two
          native APIs to comply with the requirements we had for response time:{' '}
          <em>
            <a

          </em>
          . The data collected from the patient interaction with the keyboard during a game session
          was pre-processed in the frontend side before being sent to the backend, where the metrics
          engine validated and prepared the data points for exploratory analysis. We defined as our
          strategy to develop and test the games in sequence, starting from game 1 to game 7. This
          testing process that was split between our team and the client&apos;s team denoted itself
          as time-consuming, because it required human intervention to test possible scenarios and
          replicated any findings. We are sure that automation would have reduced the testing time
          and brought confidence to the released code. Unfortunately, we didn&apos;t find a more
          productive and accessible way within the 6-month deadline and resources both teams had
          available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding the dashboard, as mentioned, we reduced the development time significantly by
          building a components library from the NFB dashboard. This library had every component we
          needed for the NG dashboard, the only difference being that the Games UI were integrated
          with the dashboard in order to provide a seamless experience for the technician conducting
          the treatment.
