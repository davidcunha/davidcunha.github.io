        <p>
          My contribution to this project started when I was hired to join the
          backend development team that consisted of one developer at that time.
          I had a small period of adaptation where I was presented to the data
          model, existing features, and AWS services management. Precisely after
          that period, the actual backend developer quit the project, hence my
          first challenge was to take over the whole PHP codebase, which is not
          my primary programming language, and deliver the required
          features/fixes without disrupting the actual pace of development.

          The focus was building new personalization features, such as
          recommendation feed, recipes of the day, adding other types of media
          to the recipes representation, like videos, aiming to offer a better
          experience for home’s cooks.{' '}

          . During the following 10 weeks, we teamed up in London to brainstorm
          what would be the best process to integrate Mucho with products from
          Waitrose’s supermarkets. Since I didn’t have access initially to an
          internal product API from Waitrose, we opted to scrap (with Waitrose’s
          authorization) the products data from their e-commerce website. This
          option enabled us to build and test a successful click and collect

          Lately, we forked the codebase and created a new version of the
          app/backend for Colombia costumers, which is an emerging market for
          foodies. This operation required the setup of testing and production
          environments, as a Git workflow, adequate for an easy development
          process.

          Our methodology included weekly Sprints and User Acceptance Testing
          for each feature/fix.

          The architecture consists of numerous REST APIs serving a mobile
          application developed in iOS. In the backend, I developed a
          content-based filtering recommendation engine that returns daily
          personal recommendations — catering to any of the user’s dietary
          requirements or allergies. For a smooth configuration, the
          recommendation engine has a set of configuration rules with parameters
          that can be adjusted by an Admin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the app offers a friendly search UI for finding recipes that
          match user’s requirements. As we needed a scalable and trustable
          search engine system, Elastic Search was the selected tool. The
          queries results and used objects for users’ feed are cached in a
          memory object caching system such as Memcached.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most notables features, depicted in the architecture, is
          the digital cupboard. The purpose of the cupboard is solely to track
          ingredients quantities ordered and consumed by each user, to make sure
          that the system reduces waste and give users the most value they can
          get for the money they’re spending, in future orders.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole backend infrastructure was set up and scaled by Amazon Web
          Services, with both testing and production environment, where we take
          advantage of the several services provided in AWS catalog. Amazon
          Beanstalk for handling deployments, EC2 managed by Beanstalk for
          server virtualization, S3 for static assets, RDS for the relational
          database, SQS when running background tasks, ElastiCache for caching,
          and Elasticsearch for the search engine.
