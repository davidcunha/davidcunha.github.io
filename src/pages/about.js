            productive. He is naturally curious and seeks new challenges,
            working at his best when he sees genuine issues that new
            technologies can solve. As a developer, he also has a clear
            understanding of how to weight the business benefits tech work can
            have. He is invested in people, trying to understand where people
            come from, which makes him a great team member.‚Äù

          I started as a self-taught programmer a couple of years ago, and as
          many devs, I suffered from <em>impostor syndrome</em> early in my
          career. I always compared myself to other peers and felt terrible
          because my foundations weren‚Äôt rock-solid at a time the team needed me
          for delivering high-quality code.
        </p>
        <p>And my dear friends, this feeling can hit you hard...</p>
        <p>
          So I spent years reading books, networking with other developers, and
          most importantly coding different type of projects from frontend to
          backend and distributed computing, while I was working in several
          companies.

          . However, none of my efforts were targeted to build actual products
          that normal people would use. Believe me, R&amp;D is paramount for
          brainstorming and delivering, today, what could be tomorrow‚Äôs
          products. However, at that time, what I really wanted was to solve

          Although bear that none of the concepts learned are silver bullets.
          There will still be moments of anxiety over meeting deadlines, poor
          communication, frustration with technology, low energy, or people not
          supporting your ideas, even with the best team available. Connecting
