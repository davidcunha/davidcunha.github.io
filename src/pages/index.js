        <p>
          I&apos;m a professional Software Engineer and Scrum Master with more than 6 years of
          experience based in sunny Portugal, interested in building scalable web apps and
          businesses that make people happy.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Building a business isn&apos;t easy. Even worse a profitable one.
          As an Engineer close to business decisions that can impact the happiness of end-users and consequently,
          the product&apos;s growth, I help to get the most value by asking questions.<br />
          I believe in transparency, inspection, and adaptation between team members and client, in order to be able to succeed.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In late 2016, I started an exciting project at Viana do Castelo, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/vianatechmeetups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Viana Tech Meetups</a>,
          that brings tech meetups and workshops to a local community that until then didn&apos;t have events to attend and network.
          Now with more than 600 members, 20 events, several companies involved,
          and the support of the local university, we were able to bring speakers from companies
          such as Talkdesk, Prozis, Netlify, InVision, Taxify/Bolt, Paddypower Betfair, Consensys, or Skyscanner.

            ‚ÄúI&apos;ve had the pleasure of growing our business alongside David for the past 4 years
            in Mucho, seeing him grow as a developer and into his different endeavors. David is
            extremely diligent, clear and productive. He is naturally curious and seeks new
            challenges, working at his best when he sees genuine issues that new technologies can
            solve. As a developer, he also has a clear understanding of how to weight the business
            benefits tech work can have. He is invested in people, trying to understand where people
            come from, which makes him a great team member.‚Äù
