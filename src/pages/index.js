          Building a business isn&apos;t easy. Even worse a profitable one. As an Engineer close to
          business decisions and building features that can impact the happiness of end-users and
          consequently product&apos;s growth, I get acquainted with the business domain I&apos;m
          working on. Knowing how to explain technical decisions to non-tech-savvy, and how to help
          businesses get the most value by asking the right questions, is what I believe is
          fundamental to succeed.

            ‚ÄúI&apos;ve had the pleasure of growing our business alongside David for the past 4 years
            in Mucho, seeing him grow as a developer and into his different endeavors. David is
            extremely diligent, clear and productive. He is naturally curious and seeks new
            challenges, working at his best when he sees genuine issues that new technologies can
            solve. As a developer, he also has a clear understanding of how to weight the business
            benefits tech work can have. He is invested in people, trying to understand where people
            come from, which makes him a great team member.‚Äù
